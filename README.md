# NSDP-Per-Capita-Growth-Prediction
### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) per capita for Indian states in the years 2025 and 2030. The study aims to analyze historical trends, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and evaluate the social and economic impact of the predictions.

### Datasets Used

- State Name: Identifies the state/region.
- Year: Denotes the recorded year of NSDP.
- NSDP Per Capita (â‚¹): Represents the per capita NSDP in Indian Rupees.
