# NSDP-Per-Capita-Growth-Prediction
### Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) per capita for Indian states in the years 2025 and 2030. The study aims to analyze historical trends, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and evaluate the social and economic impact of the predictions.

### Datasets Used
The following dataset gives some of the latest available nominal NSDP per capita figures for the Indian States of India at current prices in Indian rupees. This dataset also contains geometrical information about the states which allows the users to plot interesting visualizations on the Indian or State Maps

### Tools and Technologies Implemented
The project utilize multiple tools and technologies, including:
- Programming Language: Python
- Data Handling: Pandas, Numpy
- Machine Learning Models: Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression)
- Statistical Analysis: SciPy
- Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook

### Project Setup and Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system
- Python (>=3.8)
- Jupyter Notrebook or any Python IDE (VS Code, PyCharm etc)
- Required Python libraries:
  - pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy

### Outcomes:
- Insightful data visualizations of historical and projected economic growth.
- A predictive model that estimates NSDP per capita for future years
